# Style guide

This project follows the [Zig style guide](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Style-Guide).

## Additional guidelines
* All code should be formatted using `zig fmt`.
* New code should follow similar conventions to what is already in place.
* Don't abbreviate variable names, prefer long and descriptive names.
* Prefer multiple lines over clever one liners when it helps readability.
* Comments should be full sentences (capitals, punctuation, etc).
* Comments should not be used to fix hard to read code. If code needs comments to be understood, it should be refactored to be more self-documenting.
